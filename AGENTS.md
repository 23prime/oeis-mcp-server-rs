# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## General agent rules

- When users ask questions, answer them instead of doing the work.

### Shell Rules

- Always use `rm -f` (never bare `rm`)
- Before running a series of `git` commands, confirm you are in the project root; if not, `cd` there first. Then run all subsequent `git` commands from that directory without the `-C` option.
